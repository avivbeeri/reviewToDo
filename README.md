# reviewToDo

A terminal application that displays pull request comments as a to-do list.

This project only advances during my one-hour lunch break.

Roadmap:
* Accept a user's bitbucket authentication details. (Done)
* Save their details
* Display the list of all repositories they can view. (Mostly done. Shows the team repos because that is what I need)
* Display the open pull requests in a repo (Done)
* Show a list of comments
* Allow comments to be viewed in context of code the comment was made for.
* Let the user check off comments with a reply.
